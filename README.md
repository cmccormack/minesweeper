# Minesweeper

## Description
Simple Minesweeper Game in JS


## Rules of Minesweeper
* A squares "neighbors" are the squares adjacent above, below, left, right, and all 4 diagonals. Squares on the sides of the board or in a corner have fewer neighbors. The board does not wrap around the edges.
* If you open a square with 0 neighboring bombs, all its neighbors will automatically open. This can cause a large area to automatically open.
* To remove a bomb marker from a square, point at it and right-click again.
* The first square you open is never a bomb.
* If you mark a bomb incorrectly, you will have to correct the mistake before you can win. * Incorrect bomb marking doesn't kill you, but it can lead to mistakes which do.
* You don't have to mark all the bombs to win; you just need to open all non-bomb squares.
* Right-clicking twice will give you a question mark symbol which can be useful if you are unsure about a square
